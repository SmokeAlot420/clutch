<!-- CLUTCH v2 Phase Checkpoint Format

After each phase commit, append a checkpoint block using this exact schema:

## Phase N: <Phase Name>
- **Status**: completed | in-progress | deferred
- **Commit**: <SHA> (<short message>)
- **Execution Mode**: team (N executors) | sequential | solo
- **Team Failure**: none | yes (fell back to sequential at turn N)
- **Workstreams**:
  - workstream-1: completed (files: a.py, b.py, c.py)
  - workstream-2: completed (files: d.py, e.py)
  - workstream-3: skipped (reason: not needed for MVP)
  - workstream-4: deferred (reason: context budget exhausted)
- **Tests**: X passing (Y new)
- **Files Changed**: +N -M lines across K files
- **Validation**: PASS in N cycles
- **Context Budget**: ~X% remaining after this phase
- **Next Phase**: Phase N+1 requires: <brief description of what next phase needs>
- **Resume Instructions**: <exact steps for a cold-start session to continue>

### Resume Instructions Detail

A new session reading ONLY this file + the PRD can continue Phase N+1 by:
1. Reading the PRD for Phase N+1 scope
2. Noting which phases are complete (above) and their commit SHAs
3. Checking which workstreams were deferred (may need to be picked up)
4. Generating the PRP for Phase N+1 (or using existing PRP if already generated)
5. Executing with CLUTCH: `/clutch <PRD_PATH> <N+1>`

### Key State for Cold-Start
- All completed phase commits are on the current branch
- Deferred workstreams listed above need manual resolution or inclusion in future phases
- The git log from the commit SHAs above shows exactly what was implemented
- No conversation context from prior sessions is needed
